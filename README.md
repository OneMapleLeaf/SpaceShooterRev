_import javax.swing.JFrame_ - Used to import packages that are built-in to java.

_public class Frame extends JFrame_ - The class was declared and also it uses a keyword __extends__ so that we can apply the _JFrame_ in our program.

_public Frame()_ What we call a __Constructor__, it's role is to *construct*/*initialize* the variables that are need for our program.

__public static void main(String[] args)__ acts as our *main* method and under that method is we call our class which is *Frame*, hence the __new Frame()__ was added to the main method.
